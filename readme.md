# FellowFreiesWissen_BIDS

This GitHub repository collects tools to give easier access to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS). This is a work in progress and everyone is invited to contribute, comment or help test the instruments.

This repository is part of the Wikimedia felllowship on open science [Fellows Freies Wissen](https://de.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Fellow-Programm_Freies_Wissen/Einreichungen/Open_Science_f%C3%BCr_bildgebende_Verfahren:_Standardisierte_Experimente_f%C3%BCr_BIDS). My main goal is to collect experiment scripts, e.g., PsychoPy, Psychtoolbox that directly output into a BIDS strucutre. The idea is that when coding future experiments, everyone can copy/paste the relevant BIDS output lines of code for their specific toolbox.

To collect as many experiments as possible and see how other people have adressed this issue, I need help. So please add to this collection!

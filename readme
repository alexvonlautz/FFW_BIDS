FellowFreiesWissen_BIDS

This GitHub repository collects tools to give easier access to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS). This is a work in progress and everyone is invited to contribute, comment or help test the instruments.

This repository is part of the Wikimedia felllowship on open science (Fellows Freies Wissen). My main goal is to collect experiment scripts, e.g., PsychoPy, Psychtoolbox that directly output into a BIDS strucutre. The idea is that when coding future experiments, everyone can copy/paste the relevant BIDS output lines of code for their specific toolbox.

To collect as many experiments as possible and see how other people have adressed this issue, I need help. So please add to this collection!
